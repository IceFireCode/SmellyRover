# SmellyRover Project

Graduation project yellow belt

## Evaluation of the Project

I managed to work 5 full pomodoro sessions on the project. I am happy with the result. Mainly because I basically had no moments in which I stopped the process of refactoring. I just kept going from one small task to the next.

I probably should improve my discipline though. Working my way line by line through the code is not really my strength. At some point I see that I completely missed for example some else cases I should have removed before already. And creating a backlog with all the smells right t the start of the project is also something I didn't do. I just added taks while working on other tasks.

About the 'helper': I used IntelliJ and for me that means I have Github CopPilot making suggestions while I type. I used it to write some of the code, some of the backlog and some of the notes. And of course the Mikado annotations. I hope I did the Mikado thing somewhat correctly, by the way.
