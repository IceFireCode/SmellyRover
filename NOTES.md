## 🍅 Pomodoro 2

[X] read through the code, line by line, refactor on the fly
[X] create plan to use an enum for Direction (North, South, East, West)
[X] use an enum for Direction (North, South, East, West)

## 🍅 Pomodoro 3

[x] improve turnLeft and turnRight code when we have enum for Direction, getting rid of else statements
[x] merge turnLeft and turnRight functions
[x] use an enum for Command (L, R, M)

## 🍅 Pomodoro 4

[x] use enum in executeCommands

[x] create helper functions for moving to a Direction
[ ] create helper functions for turning given a Direction
